My Online Portfolio

Website is the index.html file. I added a navbar to the design and the site uses bootstrap for dropdown navbar functionality. Used srcset to provide responsive images and grunt to create these images. Supporting CSS, Java, and images are in respective folders. Kept multiple CSS files for ease of readability and clarity of function. All code is my own with one exception. A CSS fallback solution to using background-clip:text (better than my initial idea) is from http://nimbupani.com/using-background-clip-for-text-with-css-fallback.html.
